Didn't create any additional classes just a few getters and setters to pass and set values in other classes. 
Simulation calss creates an array of people that then enter the building (some are already in the building just for fun)
then it lets them all enter the elevator to create the jobs. Elevator is started and processes all jobs. Each person
holds a refference to first name, last name, floor it's at and where it wants to go. There are two toString methods
one to describe a person another to show the location of the person. In floor class implemented the GetEmptyPosition
to obtain a first empty position in the array and place the person that exists the same floor there.
